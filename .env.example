# If the guard is changed, Firefly III uses the 'REMOTE_USER' header as per RFC 3875.

# Firefly III uses email addresses as user identifiers. When you're using an external authentication guard
# that doesn't do this, Firefly III is incapable of emailing you. Messages sent to "Bill Gates" always fail.
#
# However, if you set this value, Firefly III will store the value from this header as the user's backup
# email address and use it to communicate. So user "Bill Gates" could still have
# the email address "bill@microsoft.com".
