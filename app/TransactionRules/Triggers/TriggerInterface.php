     * A trigger is said to "match anything", or match any given transaction,

     * are the "AmountMore"-trigger combined with an amount of 0: any given transaction
     * has an amount of more than zero! Other examples are all the "Description"-triggers
     * which have hard time handling empty trigger values such as "" or "*" (wild cards).
     *

     * can stop the storing / updating the trigger. If the trigger is in any way restrictive
     * (even if it will still include 99.9% of the users transactions), this method MUST return
     * false.
