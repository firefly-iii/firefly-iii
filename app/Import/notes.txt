The import routine is as follows:

1. Upload and setup:

User uploads a file with entries. The Setup/SetupInterface gives the user
the opportunity (in any number of steps) to do the necessary configuration.
This could also be skipped of course. An ImportJob object is created with a
basic and empty configuration.

Helper classes are as follows, greatly modelled to the CSV importer:

- The Mapper classes give back lists of Firefly objects. You can show them to the
user in order to help you convert text values to their Firefly counterparts.
For example, the user maps "Gcrsr" to category Groceries.
- The Converter classes exist to help convert text values to their Firely counterparts.
Feed "AB12ABCD897829" to the AssetAccountIban Converter and you should end up with a new
or found asset account. The previously built mapping is used to narrow it down. Submit an empty
mapping if this one is not relevant.

The mapping and possibly other configuration options are stored in a newly created
ImportJob object, stored in the database. This import job holds a reference to the uploaded file
(placed encrypted in /storage/uploads) and the status of the import.

2. Actual import

Using either the command line or the web interface the user can tell Firefly to start the import.

The ImporterInterface runs and creates an ImportEntry for each line, blob or whatever distinction it
wants.

For each line, the ImporterInterface should run each field through the selected Converter in order
to convert the text values to their Firefly counterparts. Again, this is modelled to the CSV importer
and may need an update for MT940.

In any case, this newly minted set of ImportEntries (it cannot be saved or stored atm,
this has to be done in one go) is then fed to the ImportValidator which will reject entries
(almost never) and corrects fields if necessary.

- Adds a default description if there isn't one present.
- Adds the date (today) if no date is present.
- Determins the type of transaction (withdrawal, deposit, transfer).
- Determins the types of accounts involved (asset, expense, revenue).
- Determins the currency of the transaction.

This set of corrected ImportEntries is then fed to the ImportStorage class which will generate
TransactionJournals, Transactions and other related objects.
