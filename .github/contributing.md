# Welcome to Firefly III on Github!

:+1::tada: Thank you for taking the time to contribute something to Firefly III!

## Feature requests

I am always interested in expanding Firefly III's many features. Just open a ticket or [drop me a line](mailto:thegrumpydictator@gmail.com).

## Pull requests

When contributing to Firefly III, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method. I can only accept pull requests against the `develop` branch, never the `master` branch.

## Translations :us: :fr: :de:

If you see a spelling error, grammatical error or a weird translation in your language, please join [our CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/firefly-iii) project. There, you can submit your translations and fixes. The GitHub repository will download these automatically and they will be included in the next release.
