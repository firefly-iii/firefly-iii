# Welcome to Firefly III on Github!

:+1::tada: Thank you for taking the time to contribute something to Firefly III!

## Bugs

First of all: thank you for reporting a bug instead of ditching the tool altogether. If you find a bug, please take the time and see if the [demo site](https://demo.firefly-iii.org/) is also suffering from this bug. Include as many log files and details as you think are necessary. Bugs have a lot of priority! 

## Installation problems

Please take the time to read the [installation guide FAQ](https://firefly-iii.org/installation-guide-faq/) and make sure you search through closed issues for the problems other people have had. Your problem may be among them! If not, open an issue and I will help where I can.
