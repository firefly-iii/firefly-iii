<!--
Thank you for submitting new code to Firefly III, or any of the related projects. Please read the following rules carefully.

- Do not submit solutions for problems that are not already reported in an issue
- Firefly III can't be your learning experience. If you're new to all of this, please go be new somewhere else
- Do not open PRs to "discuss" possible solutions or to "get feedback" on your code. I don't have time for that.
- Pull requests for the MAIN branch will be closed.
- DO NOT include translated strings in your PR.

Perhaps open an issue first, before you open a PR?
