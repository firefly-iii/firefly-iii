# Support [![Average time to resolve an issue](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/resolution/firefly-iii/firefly-iii.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/firefly-iii/firefly-iii "Average time to resolve an issue")

:+1::tada: Thank you for taking the time to contribute something to Firefly III!

## Reporting an issue

First of all: thank you for reporting a bug instead of ditching the tool altogether. Bugs have a lot of priority!

1. Open bugs will have open issues, so search for one first.
2. If your feature request is already there, vote on it with :+1: or :-1: reactions.
3. Do NOT hijack old issues with the bug you found, open your own issue.
4. If relevant, take the time and see if the [demo site](https://demo.firefly-iii.org/) is also suffering from your
   issue.
5. If relevant, read the [documentation](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/).

Please follow these guidelines when opening new issues:

## Writing good issues

- File a single issue for a single problem or feature requests. Feel free to open multiple issues.
- Collect as many details as you can.
- Be clear and specific, and state what you're not sure about.

Only then [create a new issue](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/new/choose)!

## Issue closure and abandonment policy

- Issues can be converted into discussions if it's not a bug or feature request.
- Features that won't be implemented will be labelled "
  wontfix". [This isn't personal](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/explanation/more-information/what-its-not/).
- Issues can be closed if they're duplicates of other issues.
- Issues can be closed if the answer is in the FAQ.
- Issues will be closed automatically after 14 days.
- Issues will be locked automatically after 90 days.
