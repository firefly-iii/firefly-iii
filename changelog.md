## 6.3.0 - 2025-08-17

> [!WARNING]
> Firefly III v6.3.0 introduces a lot of API changes that deal with multi-currency support. Make sure your beloved apps are updated to support this.

- Renamed all instances of "default" and "native" currency to "primary" currency. This influences translations and API endpoints. The database is not changed because that's difficult to do reliably.

- Any API-field called `default_*` or `native_*`. Use `primary_*` instead.
- All v2 endpoints.

### API

- All remaining API v2 endpoints are deprecated and removed in favour of the API v1 endpoints.
- All API read endpoints now support multi-currency. Fields such as the balance and amount fields will also be available as `pc_*`-fields. Objects with currency information also come with new `primary_currency_*` fields.
- All API read endpoints are DB optimized and should be faster.
- All documentation should be in sync again.
- [More info in the docs](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/references/firefly-iii/api/).
