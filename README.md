## More about Firefly III

Personal financial management is pretty difficult, and everybody has their own approach to it. Some people make budgets, other people limit their cashflow by throwing away their credit cards, others try to increase their current cashflow. There are tons of ways to save and earn money.

Firefly works on the principle that if you know where you're money is going, you can stop it from going there.

### Some advantages of using Firefly

- Firefly can import any CSV file, so migrating from other systems is easy.
- Firefly runs on your own server, so you are fully in control of your data. Remember, there is no such thing as "the cloud", it’s just somebody else’s computer!
- Firefly has lots of features without being fancy or bloated.
- If you feel you're missing something you can just ask me and I'll add it!

Firefly is pretty awesome. [You can read more about Firefly III, and its features, on the Github Pages](https://firefly-iii.github.io/).
